# Airline 2

Airline is a Java library providing an annotation-based framework for parsing command line interfaces.

It supports both simple single commands through to complex git style interfaces with groups and sub-groups.

Additionally it provides many powerful features including, but not limited to, the following:

- Highly customisable [Parser](http://rvesse.github.io/airline/guide/parser/)
- [User Defined Aliases](http://rvesse.github.io/airline/guide/practise/aliases.html)
- Annotation driven [restrictions](http://rvesse.github.io/airline/guide/restrictions/) framework to reduce boilerplate
- Extensible [Help](http://rvesse.github.io/airline/guide/help) system supporting multiple output formats including generating Man pages and Bash completion scripts
- [Maven Plugin](http://rvesse.github.io/airline/guide/maven-plugin/) for validation and help generation during builds

## User Guide

Our project website at [http://rvesse.github.io/airline/](http://rvesse.github.io/airline/) contains a fairly comprehensive user guide.  Some portions are still under development but it covers the vast majority of the features of the library.

## Usage

To use airline you need to add a dependency to it to your own code, the Maven artifacts are described later in this ReadMe.

You then need to use the various annotations to annotate your command classes:

- `@Command` is used to annotate classes
- `@Option` is used to annotate fields to indicate they are options
- `@Arguments` is used to annotate fields that take in arguments
- `@Inject` can be used to modularise option definitions into separate classes

Please see the [examples](airline-examples/) module for a range of examples that show off the many features of this library and practical examples of using the annotations.

Or for a quick tutorial why not read our [Introduction to Airline](http://rvesse.github.io/airline/guide/) in our User Guide.

### Quick Examples

#### Single Commands

Simply create a parser instance via `SingleCommand.singleCommand()` passing in a class that is annotated with the `@Command` annotation e.g.

```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SingleCommand<YourClass> parser = SingleCommand.singleCommand(YourClass.class);
        YourClass cmd = parser.parse(args);
        
         // Execute your command however is appropriate e.g.
         cmd.run();   
    }
```

#### Multiple Commands

Create an instance of a `Cli`, this can be done either using the `CliBuilder` or by annotating a class with the `@Cli` annotation.  This is somewhat more involved so please see the [User Guide](http://rvesse.github.io/airline/guide/#building-a-cli) or the [examples module](examples/) for proper examples.

#### Executable JAR

Note that typically you will want to create an executable JAR for your CLI using something like the Maven Shade plugin.  This will then allow you to create a simple wrapper script that invokes your CLI.

    #!/bin/bash
    # myapp
    
    java -jar my-app.jar "$@"
    
**Note:** You must use `"$@"` here as otherwise Bash may expand/interpret arguments and as a result the JVM may not receive the expected arguments that the user enters.

If this is done you can then invoke your application e.g.

     myapp --global-option command --command-option arguments
     
Or:

    myapp --global-option group --group-option command --command-option arguments

## JDK Compatibility

### Source

Our source code is Java 7 compliant.

### Build

Airline can be built with Java 7, 8, 9 or 10 and our `pom.xml` contains appropriate profile customisations to enable this.  Regardless of the version built the `pom.xml` will target Java 7 byte code.  Our official releases are built with Java 7 to maximise version compatibility.

Airline cannot currently be built with Java 11 due to Maven plugin compatibility issues.

**NB** - If you are trying to build older versions from source the relevant `pom.xml` customisations may not have existed at that time.

### Runtime

Airline is built with Java 7 so can be used with Java 7 or above.

#### JPMS

Airline does make heavy use of reflection and therefore will likely not work on the Module Path without exporting packages that contain your CLI and Command classes as part of your `module-info.java`

I do not currently use JPMS in any of my personal/work projects that use Airline and therefore there has been no testing of this.

## Maven Artifacts

This library is available from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org) with the latest stable release being `2.5.0`

Use the following maven dependency declaration:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.rvesse</groupId>
    <artifactId>airline</artifactId>
    <version>2.5.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Snapshot artifacts of the latest source are also available using the version `2.5.1-SNAPSHOT` from the [OSSRH repositories](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html#ossrh-usage-notes).

## Build Status

CI builds are run on [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/) ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rvesse/airline.png), see build information and history at https://travis-ci.org/rvesse/airline

# Historical Information

This is a substantially rewritten fork of the original [airline library](https://github.com/airlift/airline) created based on improvements predominantly developed by myself plus some minor improvements taken from the [Clark & Parsia](https://github.com/clarkparsia/airline) fork.  It has significantly deviated from the original library and gained many powerful features that differentiate it from both the original and other libraries with similar goals.

## Breaking Changes versus 1.x

Airline 2 contains significant breaking changes from Airline 1.x, please see [Migrating.md](Migrating.md) for more details on how to migrate code forward.

Airline 2.1 contains some further minor breaking changes that should only affect advanced users, again please see [Migrating.md](Migrating.md) for more details on how to migrate code forward.  Some users may need to add additional Maven dependencies if they were using help formats other than the basic CLI help.

Airline 2.2 has some minor breaking changes that may affect users of the `@Arguments` annotation, again please see [Migrating.md](Migrating.md) for more details.
